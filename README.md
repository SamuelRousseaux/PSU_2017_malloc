# PSU\_2017\_malloc


## Project
Epitech 2nd year project.

The goal of this project is to, using only brk/sbrk, rewrite the 3 following C library functions: malloc, free and realloc.




## Prerequisites
There's no prequisites to run the project.



## How to use it
To use this program, you first need to compile it using the makefile :
    
    make re && make clean

Then, you compile your program like you would do usually, and finally, you preload the library and launch your binary file :

    LD_PRELOAD=./libmy_malloc.so ./your_binary [args]
